Basically VTFEdit GUI in Blender with some additional features

# Installation. READ THIS SHORT SENTENCE I BEG YOU
Download this repo as zip, install as an addon AND RESTART BLENDER !

# Usage
Open "Image Editor" or "UV Editor" window, drag-n-drop an image so that it appears in blender and look for self-explanatory options in the N-Menu.
This addon also adds support for a variety format, basically if Blender opens it, then the addon is able to process it (this applies to batch convert too).
Aka the addon is capable of processing .psd files.


# Limitations
 - Animated textures are not supported yet
 - Images packed into the blend fille cannot be exported yet
